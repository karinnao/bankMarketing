Project Goal 
The goal of a project is to predict wheter a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on 
demographic data and historical marketing campaign interactions. By identifying the most likely subscribers,
a bank can optimize its marketing resources, improve conversion rates, and reduce spendings on unnecessary phone calls to uninterested leads
